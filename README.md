# Mulch Calculator
## _Scenario_
Premier Landscaping, a local area mulch delivery service, charges for mulch based on three factors: 
1. cubic yards of mulch needed
2. distance needed to travel to deliver the mulch
3. sales tax due on the cost of the mulch

| Cubic yards | Price per cubic yard |
|   <= 5      | $36 per cubic yard (minimum order is 3 yards)                    |   
|   > 5 and <= 10 | $36 per cubic yard for the first 5 cubic yards plus
$33 per cubic yard for each cubic yard over 5
                    |
|    > 10     | $36 per cubic yard for the first 5 cubic yards plus 
$33 per cubic yard for each cubic yard over 5 up to 10 plus 
$30 per cubic yard for each cubic yard over 10                      |
